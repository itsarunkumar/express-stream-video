To upload a video file to the REST API you just created, you can use an API testing tool like Postman. Here are the steps:

Open Postman and create a new request by clicking the "New" button.

Choose "POST" as the request method, and enter the URL of your server's upload endpoint, which in this example is http://localhost:3000/api/upload.

Click on the "Body" tab and select "form-data" as the body type.

Click on the "Choose Files" button and select the video file you want to upload.

Click the "Send" button to send the request.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a response in Postman indicating that the file was uploaded successfully.
